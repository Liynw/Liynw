## üéâHi there! I'm [Saiodgm](https://github.com/cqbzljt). Very nice to meet you.

@cqbzljt is my old nickname. If you don't want to type my name, you can call me ljt. @[MqvqM](https://github.com/MqvqM) is my tester.

### Why use GitHub?

I used to be an [OIer](https://oier.baoshuo.dev/). Due to my friend [XSC062](https://xsc062.gitee.io) (an OIer too), I got to know [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and start to make my own blog.
